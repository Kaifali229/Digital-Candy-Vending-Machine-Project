Tools: Vivado, Nexys A7 FPGA Board
Description:
Implemented a digital vending machine using Verilog HDL on the Nexys A7 FPGA. The machine accepts and accumulates coins, handles change mechanisms, and dispenses candy based on input credits. The system architecture is based on a Finite State Machine (FSM) and demonstrates core digital logic principles including sequential control and synchronous state transitions.
